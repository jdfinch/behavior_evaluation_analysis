      "Hi!\n",
      "Hello! How are you? How is this week been for you? Any travel plans?\n",
      "This week has been alright, I've had a lot of time to relax which is nice. My nearest travel plans are in the summer, when I'm planning on taking a trip to Italy!\n",
      "Nice!! Where is your last italy trip? Are you visiting your family? What time of year is it?\n",
      "Last time I went to Italy I went to Rome, Florence, and Cinque Terre. I'm just going to have a relaxing vacation in the summertime.\n",
      "I was just there - I went to mantio and rome, and went to the piazza gaolone and the colisseum. We ate tons of pasta in the city of roma. Oh my god the street food there was amazing.\n",
      "From what I remember, I agree that the street food was phenomenal. It was a few years ago that I went, so my memory isn't the greatest. But either way, I'm very excited to go there again!\n",
      "Oh really? What was the best street food in italy you had there then? Yeah it will be great to visit all of them again.\n",
      "I remember having chocolate pastries from street vendors every morning. They were so good!\n",
      "Yeah it is a big thing there I hear. They sell them in parks in america too which is cool.\n",
      "That is cool, although I must say, I've never had one in America that was as good as the ones I had in Italy.\n",
      "Yeah they are also super popular in italian american communities in the us for the same reason. Also have you tried any street food yet?\n",
      "I've had some American street food every one in a while. I live near New York City, so I've seen a lot of street vendors.\n",
      "That's cool. What kind of food do they have? Do they serve street food in other countries as well?\n",
      "There are a lot of different kinds of street food. My favorite is a vendor called \"nuts4nuts\" and they sell sweet roasted peanuts. And yes, I think other countries have street food, although I don't know from experience.\n",
      "Oh wow that sounds really good. The last thing I had was fries and I was in awe. What is your all time favorite food?\n",
      "My mom makes really great homemade meatballs, I'd say that is my favorite food. How about you?\n",
      "Wow that's sounds good! I love italian food! But I like to try new restaurants I would not know where to find italians. What kind of street foods do you like?\n",
      "I like to try street food I haven't had before. I think it's a good way to try new things!\n",
      "That is a good idea. I will check it out! When were you in germany?\n",
      "I've never been to Germany, although I'd love to go! I've heard it's beautiful there.\n",
      "Yes it is...and I know some great pasta restaurants...lol! Maybe you and your family will also like to go there. Maybe we can get you a piano lesson once my grandmother passes away, she's good at it.\n",
      "If I ever go to Germany, I'd love some restaurant recommendations! Are you familiar with Germany?\n",
      "I am not terribly familiar with german food, but I'm learning as I find out there are many types. So what types of food do you and family like to eat?\n",
      "We like most types of food, however I've never been a big fan of Greek food or fish. Although, I have been trying to branch out and try sushi lately.\n",
      "Do you like any other types of cuisine? Like italian or mexican?\n",
      "I do! As a New Yorker, I'm a big fan of pizza. And I like Mexican food as well, there's a great Mexican deli in my hometown.\n",
      "That's so cool. You live in a new york city? Which one? I've read about the new yorks of the world: newark, newark penn, brooklyn\n",
